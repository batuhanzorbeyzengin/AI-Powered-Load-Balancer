# AI-Powered Load Balancer

## Overview

This project implements an advanced, AI-powered load balancer system that uses machine learning techniques to optimize request routing, predict traffic patterns, and adapt to changing server conditions in real-time. It's designed to handle complex scenarios and provide intelligent load balancing for high-traffic applications.

## Features

- AI-driven traffic prediction and server selection
- Anomaly detection for identifying unusual request patterns
- Content-aware routing based on request characteristics
- User behavior analysis for optimized request handling
- Real-time performance monitoring and adaptive load balancing
- Energy-efficient server management
- Caching optimization based on content popularity predictions
- Comprehensive analytics and reporting
- Secure routing with JWT authentication
- WebSocket support for real-time dashboard updates

## System Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected modules:

- **LoadBalancer**: Core module that handles request routing
- **MLModels**: Machine learning models for various predictions
- **ServerProfiler**: Monitors and profiles connected servers
- **ContentAnalysis**: Analyzes incoming request content
- **CacheOptimizer**: Optimizes caching strategies
- **SecurityRouter**: Handles security-related routing decisions
- **EnergyOptimizer**: Manages energy-efficient server utilization
- **AnalysisModule**: Generates reports and analytics

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-loadbalancer.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd ai-loadbalancer
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database (MongoDB):
   - Install MongoDB if not already installed
   - Create a new database named `loadbalancer`

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update the variables in `.env` with your specific configuration

## Configuration

Modify `config/config.js` to adjust various system parameters:

- Server ports
- Database connection strings
- JWT secret
- Machine learning model parameters
- Caching settings

## Usage

1. Start the load balancer:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Access the dashboard:
   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3010/dashboard`

3. Monitor real-time analytics and server performance through the dashboard.

## Modules

### LoadBalancer

Handles the core load balancing logic, integrating predictions from ML models to make intelligent routing decisions.

### MLModels

Contains various machine learning models for traffic prediction, server selection, user behavior analysis, content popularity prediction, and anomaly detection.

### ServerProfiler

Monitors connected servers, tracking their performance, load, and other relevant metrics.

### ContentAnalysis

Analyzes incoming requests to extract relevant features for the ML models.

### CacheOptimizer

Implements intelligent caching strategies based on content popularity predictions and user behavior.

### SecurityRouter

Handles security-related routing decisions and implements authentication mechanisms.

### EnergyOptimizer

Manages server power states to optimize energy consumption while maintaining performance.

### AnalysisModule

Generates comprehensive reports and analytics on system performance and behavior.

## API Reference

- `GET /api/dashboard/data`: Retrieve dashboard data
- `POST /api/train`: Trigger ML model training
- `GET /generate-analysis`: Generate a full system analysis report

For a complete API reference, please refer to the [API Documentation](./docs/api.md).

## Machine Learning Models

The system utilizes several machine learning models:

1. Traffic Prediction Model
2. Server Selection Model
3. User Behavior Model
4. Content Popularity Model
5. Anomaly Detection Model

For more details on these models, refer to the [MLModels README](./src/modules/mlModels/README.md).

## Load Balancing Strategies

The load balancer implements several strategies:

- Weighted Round Robin
- Least Connection
- Fastest Response Time
- Geographic proximity
- Content-based routing

These strategies are dynamically selected based on current conditions and ML model predictions.

## Monitoring and Analytics

The system provides real-time monitoring through a web-based dashboard, showing:

- Server load distribution
- Traffic patterns
- Anomaly detection alerts
- Performance metrics
- ML model accuracy

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

For load testing, use the provided script:

```
node src/loadTester.js
```

## Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) in front of the load balancer
2. Configure SSL/TLS
3. Set up a production-grade MongoDB instance
4. Adjust environment variables for production settings
5. Use a process manager like PM2 to run the application

Refer to [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md) for detailed instructions.
